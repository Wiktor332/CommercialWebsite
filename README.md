# CommercialWebsite
My very first website. I developed it for a friend who works in construction and runs a sole proprietorship. The tech stack used includes **HTML**, **CSS** (SCSS), and **JavaScript**. The entire code was written in Visual Studio Code.

I utilized **GIT** for version control and **Jenkins** for continuous integration and future development. This project was entirely conceived by me, and I handled both the website's design and technical aspects from inception to completion.

Building this website required numerous hours spent on YouTube tutorials, StackOverflow, and various technical documentations. I've decided to host this website via AWS Amplify and use AWS Route 53 for hosted zones because i've had 3rd party domain provider.
